          <h3 id="">Keeping Up with the Pace of Change</h3>
          The enterprise technology industry has been changing at lightning speed. Customers are seeking new and faster ways to integrate disruptive technologies with their existing infrastructure in order to remain competitive. They are also more demanding than ever. They want a simple way to get hands-on with a product whenever, wherever.
          <p><br>
          Yet, these new customer needs and expectations don’t quite align with the traditional enterprise sales cycle -- one that is plagued by a long, costly and complex evaluation and approval process. The enterprise sales cycle typically offers interaction with limited usage and visibility, which in turn, reduces the speed of product adoption and integration at the enterprise level.

          TechAccelerator was founded by David Hekimian, the former CTO of Trace3, a Southern California-based Value-Added Reseller (VAR). Over the course of fifteen years, David worked with a variety of companies -- startups to mature corporations -- to help them develop product vision, go-to-market strategies, and scalable business models to increase revenue. He became increasingly frustrated with the common sales hurdle culprits:
          <ul>
          <li>Long demo and PoC periods</li>
          <li>Time wasted on bad opportunities</li>
          <li>Effort required to maintain a lab</li>
          <li>Inconsistent messaging across channel and sales teams</li>
          <li>Difficulty scaling sales activities</li>
          <li>Inability to quickly gather feedback and iterate</li>
          <li>High cost of shipping equipment</li>
          <li>Poor return on traditional enablement efforts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          In 2012, David started TechAccelerator with one goal in mind: to create a platform that speeds up and simplifies the enterprise sales cycle.
          </p>
          The TechAccelerator platform has evolved over the years to empower your ecosystem. We enable:
          <ul>
          <li>Manufacturers</li>
          <li>Value Added Resellers (VARs)</li>
          <li>Distributors</li>
          <li>System Integrators</li>
          <li>Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)</li>
          <li>Enterprise IT Departments</li>
          </ul>
          TechAccelerator provides on-demand, hands-on lab environments that educate, engage and ultimately empower enterprise customers, direct sales teams and channel partners, so they can get from demo to PoC to PO faster.
